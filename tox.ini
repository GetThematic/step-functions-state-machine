# Tox (http://tox.testrun.org/) is a tool for running tests
# in multiple virtualenvs. This configuration file will run the
# test suite on all supported python versions. To use it, "pip install tox"
# and then run "tox" from this directory.

# this is necessary due to a bug in tox that doesn't reload requirements files.
# instead of changing this and committing, it's easier to just set the --recreate
# flag in the job configuration in jenkins e.g. ```tox --recreate```
